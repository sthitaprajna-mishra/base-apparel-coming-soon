## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript - for email validation

### What I learned

This was another opportunity for me to hone my tailwind css skills. Though I am still more comfortable with SASS/SCSS or good ol' CSS, I am starting to get the hang of it.

### Continued development

It is possible to recreate this using React but for a newbie project, I am afraid it will be too much.
